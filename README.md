Semantic Project 
This repository contains the code for a Semantic Text Similarity project. Below, you'll find information about the project structure, how to install dependencies, and how to run the application.

Project Structure
FileB.py: This is the main Python file (FileB.py) containing the function semantic_score(text1, text2) for calculating the semantic similarity score between two input texts.
requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python dependencies required by the project. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
README.md: You're currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.
Installation
To install the dependencies required for the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-project.git
Navigate to the project directory: Use the following command to navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd semantic-project
Install dependencies: Install the Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
Open the Python file: Open the FileB.py file in your preferred Python editor (e.g., VS Code).

Locate the function: In FileB.py, locate the semantic_score(text1, text2) function.

Run the file: Run the FileB.py file to start the application.

Navigate to the link: Once the application is running, navigate to the provided link in your web browser.

Enter text: You will see input fields for entering two texts (text1 and text2).

Calculate similarity: Enter the texts and click the "Calculate Similarity" button.

View result: The application will display the semantic similarity score between the two input texts.

Usage
The semantic_score(text1, text2) function in B.py allows you to calculate the semantic similarity score between two input texts. You can use this function in your own Python scripts or applications by importing B and calling the semantic_score function with the desired texts.
